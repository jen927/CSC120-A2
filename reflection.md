What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

When I was stuck on finding a way to execute a function, I stepped back and took a break. I also reviewed other resources such as the questions channel in Discord.

What didn't work was attempting different codes without thinking why it may or may not work. Basically, start codiing without a plan.

Overall, I would tell students to take advantage of the resources such as office hours, TA hours, and the discord server. If you are stuck on something, ask for help. Don't struggle by yourself.
